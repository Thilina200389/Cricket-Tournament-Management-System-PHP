Automatic Archiving - When a new match is started, the previous match data is automatically archived to the Match History database to ensure no data is lost.

Real-Time Data Processing - The system processes game data in real-time using AJAX (Fetch API), updating the backend without requiring a page reload.

Cricket Rules & Logic:
Automatic Innings Switch - Detects the end of the 1st Innings (All Out or Overs completed), automatically calculates the Target Score (Runs + 1), and initiates the 2nd Innings.
DLS Method (Rain Rule) - Features a "Force Rain" trigger that applies the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern logic to reduce the target score by a specific percentage during the 2nd Innings.
Result Calculation - Automatically determines the match result (Win, Loss, or Tie) based on the final scores.

Display & Reporting:
Live Scoreboard - A public scoreboard that displays the current score, overs, wickets, and match status in real-time.
